<strong>There are some experiences that I have felt throughout my 21 years of life. First of all, if you look at the video I provided, in 2020 I started working as a full time sales girl. I work in a sdn.bhd company under the management of maahad tahfiz school in Parit, Perak. 
The product we sell is a beverage powder product in a sachet, which is the "maca coffee" brand. It was a lot of fun, because I got a variety of experiences throughout the work. I get to meet a lot of people, and I also learn how to approach people well so that they buy the product I promote.
Each week, we would go to different destinations and walk from store to store while promoting the product. Also, we often open booths in supermarkets.However, we managed to work for 1 month only. This is because, our country at that time was hit by covid19 and the entire population was instructed to sit at home when the lockdown occurred. 
Due to the lockdown as well, the company has also closed due to financial problems due to not operating for a long time and lack of customers.</strong>

<strong>At the end of 2021, I want to try another work experience. i chose to work in fnb company. I tried my luck to apply for a job at KFC and Alhamdulillah I was accepted to work there as a part time employee. Before I asked to work there, I asked my friend's opinion that it is difficult or not to work while studying. 
And almost at that kfc, all of them are my friends who are from highscholl and they say there are advantages and disadvantages of working while studying. And it turns out that I survive working there until now. I was divided into duties as a cashier and drive thru worker. Itâ€™s quite challenging and needs to get the job done quickly. 
Strong memory is also one of the must -have features. Most of the time, I go to work during a long semester break. The environment at the kfc is very fun, this is because I can work with my friends. I also learned many new things there.</strong>
